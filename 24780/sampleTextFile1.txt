//Game -  Dodge the balls.

How to play:
    arrow UP key - upward acceleration of 80 m/s^2    
    arrow DOWN key - break / downward acceleration of 50 m/s^2
    arrow RIGHT key - right acceleration of 200 m/s^2  
    arrow LEFT key - left acceleration of 200 m/s^2  

    * Getting hit by a ball applies damage to the rocket. The damage can keep increase
        if the rocket is in contact with the ball longer.
    * If the rocket falls under the window frame, rocket is crashed, and the game ends.
    * If max damgage(5) is reached, the game ends and displays the amount of time you have survived.
    
    ball's
    * The rocket cannot move beyond the side walls.
    * Balls will bounce back from side walls.

    **************************************************************************************
    * If the rocket hits ceiling, right or left wall, it will bounce back with the magnitude
        proportional to the velocity of rocket hitting the wall.
        This does not apply damage to the rocket.
    * Ball bounces off the rocket, but this does not affect the rocket's motion.

Settings:
    - Normal gravity constantly applied to the rocket.
    - Random number of Balls fall down at random location with random velocities and normal gravity applied.
    - The balls fallen under the window frame jump back to top and keep falling.
    - Max vertical velocity of balls = -150 m/s.
    - Based on the damage, the rocket loses wings, but has no effect in control.
    - Rocket shoots red boost when user presses up arrow key.
